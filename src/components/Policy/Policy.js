                    • Essential: Allow you to navigate and use all the features
                    provided by our Platform.

                    the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the
                    Platform and remember that you have visited us before; this
                    means we can identify the number of unique visitors we
                    receive. This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity
                    for the number of users that we get. So when you use our
                    Platform, we remember you and your preferences and

                    • Advertising and Targeting: These cookies collect

                    information about the pages that you visit or the functions
                    of the Platform you use, and also other information about
                    other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a
                    “market segment”. This information is only collected by
                    reference to the IP address or unique device identifier that

                    city or town you are in, together with the name of your
                    internet service provider. This information is then used to
                    place interest-based advertisements on the Platform, which
                    it is believed will be relevant to your market segment. This
